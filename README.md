# Overview

TrackSentinel is a modern Operational Technology (OT) cybersecurity platform developed to demonstrate cybersecurity monitoring, incident response, threat intelligence, executive reporting, and purple team exercises within a simulated railroad environment.

Unlike traditional SOC dashboards that focus exclusively on IT infrastructure, TrackSentinel models a railroad Operational Technology network consisting of SCADA systems, signaling infrastructure, Positive Train Control (PTC), communications equipment, engineering workstations, environmental monitoring, safety systems, and critical railroad infrastructure.

The platform combines cybersecurity operations with operational awareness, allowing simulated cyber events to influence operational telemetry, incident workflows, asset health, and executive security posture.

Although inspired by real OT security concepts, all attacks, alerts, telemetry, vulnerabilities, and incidents are fully simulated for educational, training, and portfolio purposes.

---

# Why TrackSentinel?

Industrial environments differ significantly from enterprise IT environments.

Operational Technology systems prioritize:

- Availability
- Safety
- Reliability
- Continuous operations
- Physical process control

rather than traditional confidentiality-focused enterprise security.

TrackSentinel demonstrates how cybersecurity analysts can monitor, investigate, and respond to cyber threats affecting railroad operational technology while balancing operational continuity and safety.

The platform brings together:

- Executive Cybersecurity Dashboards
- SOC Monitoring
- OT Asset Management
- Vulnerability Management
- Live Operational Telemetry
- Incident Response
- Investigation Workspaces
- Threat Intelligence
- Purple Team Exercises
- MITRE ATT&CK for ICS mappings

within a single unified training platform.

# 📈 Executive Security Dashboard

The Executive Security Dashboard provides leadership with a high-level view of the organization's current operational cybersecurity posture.

Unlike the analyst-focused RailSOC Dashboard, this interface emphasizes business risk, operational impact, and security metrics that support executive decision-making.

*(Insert Screenshot: executive-dashboard.png)*

## Executive KPIs

The dashboard continuously calculates and updates:

- Overall Security Score
- Current Threat Level
- Protected Asset Percentage
- Open Incidents
- Critical Alerts
- High-Risk Assets
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Compliance Status

---

## Threat Level Calculation

The platform dynamically determines the current operational threat level using simulated conditions.

| Threat Level | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 🟢 Normal | No significant security events detected |
| 🟡 Guarded | Elevated activity requiring analyst awareness |
| 🟠 Elevated | Multiple high-risk conditions affecting operations |
| 🔴 Critical | Active operational security incident impacting railroad systems |

Threat levels automatically update during purple team exercises and incident response activities.

---

## Executive Security Score

TrackSentinel calculates an overall security posture score using multiple simulated factors including:

- Asset Health
- Open Vulnerabilities
- Active Incidents
- Critical Alerts
- Device Availability
- High-Risk Assets
- Threat Intelligence
- Compliance Status

The score provides leadership with an easy-to-understand indicator of overall operational cybersecurity health.

---

---

## Example Vulnerability Workflow

```text
Vulnerability Identified
          │
          ▼
Risk Assessment
          │
          ▼
Prioritization
          │
          ▼
